### Instructions:

1. You only need to edit `src/app.js` file.
2. A boilerplate is already provided to you, for this exercise. But the issue with the given code is that -> it is not following `clean coding` norms.
   Your task is to clean the given code.

**NOTE:** For this exercise, you should not change the following:

1. The function name -> let the given function's name remain as -> `canDrive` and `getArea`.
2. The number of parameters given for both the functions. For eg:
   
   ```js

   canDrive(age,fuel){}

   ```
   In the above piece of code, you can change the name of `age` or `fuel`, but you should not create a function which only have either of the two, like shown below:

   ```js

   canDrive(age){}

   //or

   canDrive(fule){}

   ```

   The number of parameters for both the functions must be same.

Remember, your new `cleaned` code -- should also pass all the test cases.

Happy Coding !
